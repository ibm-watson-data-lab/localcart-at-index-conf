These clickstream events indicate when a customer logs in, adds something to a basket, completes an order, and logs out. The events are placed into configured Message Hub (Apache Kafka) that provides a scalable way to buffer the data before it is saved, analysed, and rendered. A streams flow aggregatesthese events and stores the aggregated data in a Compose for Redis database.\n\n[Part 2](#part2): A Node.js app monitors the Compose for Redis database and visualizes the aggregated data in a simple dashboard user interface. By the end of the notebook, you'll understand how to deploy a dashboard app to IBM Cloud to visualize streaming data, and how to simulate streaming data if you don't have a streaming data source.\n\n\nThis notebook runs on Python 2 with Spark 2.1.", "cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}}, {"source": "<a id=\"part1\"></a>\n\n***\n# Part 1: Capturing clickstream events for real-time analysis\n***\n\n\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-watson-data-lab/localcart-at-index-conf/master/images/dynamic_analysis_flow_part_1.png\"></img>\n\n\nIn this first example you will create a streams flow that ingests `login`, `add_to_basket` and `checkout` clickstream events, aggregates them according to our business needs and stores the aggregated data in a Redis database, which will be monitored by a real-time dashboard:\n\n<img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-watson-data-lab/localcart-at-index-conf/master/images/dynamic_analysis_streams_flow.png'></img>\n\n## Part 1 table of contents\n\n [1.1 Redis setup](#redis)<br>\n [1.2 Create a streams flow](#create_p1) <br>\n [1.3 Process login clickstream events](#login) <br>\n [1.4 Process add_to_cart clickstream events](#addtocart) <br>\n [1.5 Process checkout clickstream events](#checkout) <br>\n [1.6 Run the flow](#run_1)<br>\n\n\n<a id=\"redis\"></a>\n***\n\n## 1.1 Redis setup\n\nRedis is an in-memory database. It stores its data in RAM, making it a very fast way of storing and retrieving data. It provides a set of primitive data structures, but we only concern ourselves with [hashes](https://redis.io/commands#hash) for this exercise.\n\nA Redis hash is a data structure that allows several keys to be stored together. We are going to configure a Redis hash called `funnel` that contains the following output:\n\n- login_count - the number of people who logged into LocalCart\n- basket_count - the number of items added into a shopping cart\n- checkout_count - the number of purchases made\n- basket_total - the total price of items added into a shopping cart\n- checkout_total - the total price of items purchased\n\nThese are the outputs of the aggregation functions in our streaming pipeline. \n\n\n### 1.1.1 Collect your Redis connection information\n\n1. Open your <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://apsportal.ibm.com/settings/services?context=analytics\">IBM Cloud Data Services list</a>. A list of your provisioned services is displayed.\n1. Locate the pre-provisioned **Compose for Redis** service and click on the service instance name.\n1. Open the _Service Credentials_ tab and view the credentials.\n```\n{\n  \"db_type\": \"redis\",\n  \"maps\": [],\n  \"name\": \"b...b\",\n  \"uri_cli\": \"redis-cli -h **HOSTNAME** -p **PORT** -a **PASSWORD**\",\n  \"deployment_id\": \"5...2\",\n  \"uri\": \"redis://admin:**PASSWORD**@**HOSTNAME**:**PORT**\"\n}\n```\n\nNote your `**HOSTNAME**`, `**PORT**` and `**PASSWORD**` information.\n\n\n### 1.1.2 Verify your redis connectivity\nYou can verify your redis connectivity information in this notebook by installing the Python Redis library with the following command:", "cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}}, {"source": "!pip install redis", "metadata": {"collapsed": true}, "outputs": [], "cell_type": "code", "execution_count": null}, {"source": "We import the library and connect to Redis with the following command.

In this case, you will need to restart the notebook kernel to restore it.\n<BR>\nWe can now create streams flows that store aggregated data in Redis.", "cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}}, {"source": "<a id=\"create_p1\"></a>\n***\n\n## 1.2 Create a streams flow\n\nIn IBM Watson Data Platform, do these steps:\n\n1. Select a project that you want to contain the streams flows. Note that this project must be attached to Cloud Object Storage and not Object Storage (Swift).\n1. Click the **Assets** tab and scroll to the _Streams flows_ section. (If no section with the name is displayed the selected project is not attached to Cloud Object Storage.)\n1. Click **+ New streams flow**.\n1. In the _New Streams Flow_ window, \n  1. Enter name `aggregate_for_redis`\n  1. Select an existing Streaming Analytics service or create a new one (choosing the _Lite_ plan, which is free.) \n  1. Select **Manually**. (You will use the wizard in Example 2.)\n  1. Click **Create**.\n\nAn empty canvas is displayed, along with a list of _Source_, _Target_, _Processing and Analytics_ and _Alerts_ operators that you can choose from. Source operators load data and target operators store data.\n\n<a id=\"login\"></a>\n***\n\n## 1.3 Process login clickstream events\n\nFirst we need to collect `login` data from Message Hub and calculate the number of logins during a rolling one hour time window. The incoming `login` event payload has the following structure:\n```\n  {\n    \"customer_id\": \"13872\",\n    \"click_event_type\": \"login\",\n    \"total_price_of_basket\": \"0.0\",\n    \"total_number_of_items_in_basket\": \"0\",\n    \"total_number_of_distinct_items_in_basket\": \"0\",\n    \"event_time\": \"2017-07-11 20:10:52 UTC\"\n  }\n```\n\n\n### 1.3.1 Configure the source\n\n1. Drag a **MessageHub** source operator into the pipeline canvas.\n1. Configure the MessageHub operator:\n\t1. Add a connection to your Message Hub instance.\n\t1. Select the `login` topic.\n\t1. Click **Edit Schema** to specify the payload properties this operator will make available to operators that are connected to its output port. Since we only want to count the number of login events we only make the `customer_id` available.\n    1. Choose\n            - Attribute Name: `customer_id`\n            - Type: `Number` \n            - Path: `/customer_id` \n    1. Click **Save** and **Close**.         \n\n\nOur streams flow now has its first operator and looks like this: \n\n<img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-watson-data-lab/localcart-at-index-conf/master/images/dynamic_analysis_mh_config.png'></img>\n\n\n### 1.3.2 Set up aggregation functions\n\nStreaming data can be aggregated by applying functions such as sum, count, minimum, or maximum. The results of the aggregation can be done on the aggregation before it is written to the Redis database. Our aim is to calculate the number of people who logged into LocalCart for a sliding one-hour window.\n\nIn the streams flow canvas, do these steps:\n\n1. Drag an **Aggregation** operator from the _Processing and Analytics_ area, and then drop it on the canvas next to the Message Hub operator.\n2. Drag your mouse pointer from the output port of the Message Hub operator to the input port of the Aggregation operator to connect them.\n3. Click the **Aggregation** operator to open its _Properties_ pane. Set the following _Aggregation Window_ parameters:\n    - Type - `sliding`\n    - Time Units - `hour`\n    - Number of Time Units - `1`\n    - Partition By - leave unchanged\n    - Group By - leave unchanged\n4. In the **Functions** area of the _Aggregation Properties_ pane, define one aggregation:\n    - Aggregation 1: count the logins\n        - Output Field Name - `login_count`\n        - Function Type - `Count`\n        \n    Note: To identify how many different customers have logged in during the rolling 1 hour time window, we would use the `CountDistinct` function and apply it to `customer_id`.\n\nOur streams flow now has two connected operators: a source operator and an aggregation operator. Hover over the arrow to review the data flow between them.\n\n<img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-watson-data-lab/localcart-at-index-conf/master/images/dynamic_analysis_flow_mh_a.png'></img>\n\n\n\n### 1.3.3 Configure the target\n\nNext, add a Redis target operator. In the streams flow canvas, do these steps:\n\n1. Drag a **Redis** operator from the _Target_ area, and then drop it on the canvas next to the Aggregation operator.\n1. Drag your mouse pointer from the output port of the Aggregation operator to the input port of the Redis operator to connect them.\n1. Click the **Redis** operator to open its Properties pane. \n    - Add a connection to your Redis instance.\n      - Type in the `**HOST**`, `**PORT**` and `**PASSWORD**` credentials of your Compose for Redis service.\n    - In the **Key Template** field, type in `funnel`. \n1. Save the streams flow. The setup for `login` event processing is complete.\n\n  <img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-watson-data-lab/localcart-at-index-conf/master/images/dynamic_analysis_flow_mh_a_r.png'></img>    \n\n", "cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}}, {"source": "***", "cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}}, {"source": "<a id=\"addtocart\"></a>\n## 1.4 Process add_to_cart clickstream events\n\nNext we need to collect `add_to_cart` event data from Message Hub and calculate the number of shopping baskets and their combined value during a rolling one hour time window. The incoming `add_to_cart` event payload has the following structure:\n\n```\n{\n    \"customer_id\": \"13859\",\n    \"click_event_type\": \"add_to_cart\",\n    \"product_name\": \"Oatmeal\",\n    \"product_category\": \"Food\",\n    \"product_price\": \"2.49\",\n    \"total_price_of_basket\": \"153.41\",\n    \"total_number_of_items_in_basket\": \"19\",\n    \"total_number_of_distinct_items_in_basket\": \"6\",\n    \"event_time\": \"2017-06-23 12:56:18 UTC\"\n}\n```\n\n### 1.4.1 Configure the source, aggregation function and target for add_to_cart events\n\n1. Drag another **Message Hub** source operator into the canvas.\n1. Configure the Message Hub operator by doing these steps in the Properties pane:\n\t1. Select the Message Hub connection you've created earlier.\n\t1. Select the `add_to_cart` topic.\n\t1. Click **Edit Schema** to make the customer id and cart value available to connected operators. \n    1. The message schema can be automatically detected if a producer has already generated messages for the selected topic. Click **Detect Schema** and **Show preview**.\n      > If no messsages are displayed and the schema is not populated verify that your producer is running.\n    1. Click **Hide Preview**.\n    1. Remove all attributes except `customer_id` and `total_price_of_basket`:\n      - Attribute Name: `customer_id`\n            - Type: `Number` \n            - JSON Path: `/customer_id` \n      - Attribute Name: `total_price_of_basket` \n            - Type: `Number` \n            - JSON Path: `/total_price_of_basket` \n    1. Click **Save** and **Close**.\n1. Drag an **Aggregation** operator from the **Processing and Analytics** area, and then drop it on the canvas next to the Message Hub operator.\n1. Drag your mouse pointer from the output port of the Message Hub operator to the input port of the Aggregation operator to connect them.\n1. Click the **Aggregation** operator to open its _Properties_ pane. Set the following _Aggregation Window_ parameters:\n    - Type - `sliding`\n    - Time Units - `hour`\n    - Number of Time Units - `1`\n    - Partition By - leave unchanged\n    - Group By - leave unchanged\n1. In the **Functions** area of the _Aggregation Properties_ pane, define two aggregations:\n    - Aggregation 1: count the baskets\n        - Output Field Name - `basket_count`\n        - Function Type - `Count`\n    - Aggregation 2: Sum up basket values\n        - Output Field Name - `basket_total`\n        - Function Type - `Sum`\n        - Apply Function to - `total_price_of_basket`\n        \n1. Copy the existing **Redis** operator that's already on the canvas and paste it next to the _Aggregation_ Operator. \n1. Drag your mouse pointer from the output port of the Aggregation operator to the input port of the Redis operator to connect them.\n\n Your pipeline is now configured to stream and aggregate `login` and `add_to_cart` events:\n    \n <img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-watson-data-lab/localcart-at-index-conf/master/images/dynamic_analysis_flow_mh_a_r_2.png'></img>    \n\n1.

No errors should be reported.\n\n\n", "cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}}, {"source": "<a id=\"checkout\"></a>\n***\n\n## 1.5 Process checkout clickstream events\n\nFirst we need to create a stream that collects `checkout` event data from a Message Hub operator and calculates the number of checkouts and their combined value during a rolling one hour time window. The incoming `checkout` event payload has the following structure:\n\n```\n{\n    \"customer_id\": \"11828\",\n    \"click_event_type\": \"checkout\",\n    \"total_price_of_basket\": \"72.80000000000001\",\n    \"total_number_of_items_in_basket\": \"20\",\n    \"total_number_of_distinct_items_in_basket\": \"5\",\n    \"session_duration\": \"440\",\n    \"event_time\": \"2017-06-23 13:09:12 UTC\"\n}\n```\n\n### 1.5.1 Set up pipeline source, aggregation function and target for checkout events\n\n1. Drag another **Message Hub** source operator into the canvas.\n1. Configure the MessageHub operator by doing these steps in the Properties pane:\n\t1. Select the ClickStream Message Hub connection.\n\t1. Select the `checkout` topic.\n\t1. Click **Edit Schema** to specify the message attributes that will be consumed. Define the following attributes (by entering them manually or customizing the auto-detected schema):\n      - Attribute Name: `customer_id` \n            - Type: `Number` \n            - Path: `/customer_id` \n      - Attribute Name: `total_price_of_basket` \n            - Type: `Number` \n            - Path: `/total_price_of_basket` \n1. Drag an **Aggregation** operator from the _Processing and Analytics_ area, and then drop it on the canvas next to the Message Hub operator.\n1. Drag your mouse pointer from the output port of the Message Hub operator to the input port of the Aggregation operator to connect them.\n1. Click the **Aggregation** operator to open its _Properties_ pane. Set the following _Aggregation Window_ parameters:\n    - Type - `sliding`\n    - Time Units - `hour`\n    - Number of Time Units - `1`\n    - Partition By - leave unchanged\n    - Group By - leave unchanged\n1.

Copy the existing **Redis** operator that's already on the canvas and paste it next to the _Aggregation_ Operator. \n1. Drag your mouse pointer from the output port of the Aggregation operator to the input port of the Redis operator to connect them. The completed stream now looks as follows: <br>\n   <img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-watson-data-lab/localcart-at-index-conf/master/images/dynamic_analysis_flow_mh_a_r_2.png'></img>    \n\n1.
